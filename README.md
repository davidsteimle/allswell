# Adventures in All's Well

An urban sandbox using *[Old-School Essentials Advanced](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/rules/products/old-school-essentials-advanced-fantasy-players-tome)* rules. The "[Basic Rules](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/272802/OldSchool-Essentials-Basic-Rules)" will suffice for players without the Advanced rules.

## Available Classes

Initially, I would like to avoid any/all spellcasters. So, available classes will be:

* Acrobat
* Assassin
* Barbarian
* Fighter
* Half-elf :one:
* Halfling :two:
* Half-orc :two:
* Thief

:one: Half-elves must choose a class and gain no spellcasting  
:two: Halflings and half-orcs may be played as racial classes, or select an available class  

Class level limits for demi-humans will be respected.

## "Thief" Skills

We will be trying out the optional d6 Thief Skill rules from *[Carcass Crawler: Issue One](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/zines/products/carcass-crawler-issue-1)* from Necrotic Gnome. This is available for the following classes as indicated.

Class    | CS  | HN  | HS  | MS  | OL  | PP  | TR  | TW 
-------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: 
Acrobat  | :heavy_check_mark: |     | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |     |     |     | :heavy_check_mark: 
Assassin | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |     |     |     | 
Half-orc |     |     | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |     | :heavy_check_mark: |     | 
Thief    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | 

* **CS** climb sheer surfaces
* **HN** hear noise
* **HS** hide in shadows
* **MS** move silently
* **OL** open locks
* **PP** pick pockets
* **TR** find or remove treasure traps
* **TW** tighrope walking

A new character, from the classes above, get 1 point in each of their class' skills. They also get 4 points to distribute as they wish. No skill may have more than 5 points assigned. To use the skill, a d6 is rolled, and the skill rating indicates success or failure.

> **Example**, Cat the thief is a master pickpocket since childhood. They get 1 point in each skill, for a 1-in-6 chance of success. Cat also has 4 points to distribute. All go on **PP**, making the base chance to pick pockets a 5-in-6. George the assassin

## "Thief" Skills for Non-Thieves

*[Carcass Crawler: Issue One](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/zines/products/carcass-crawler-issue-1)* also discusses adjudicating "thief" skills by non-thieves. We will follow these guidelines.

## Fighter Combat Talents

*[Carcass Crawler: Issue One](https://necroticgnome.com/collections/zines/products/carcass-crawler-issue-1)* outlines special combat talents. We will follow these guidelines for fighters only.
